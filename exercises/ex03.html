        <h2> NEW ARRIVAL</h2>
        Two of the three would be illustrations and one is a concept piece. The first is a fan piece I did for Diablo 3 when the game first came out. I was working on Rift at the time and my piece was featured in an article on Kotaku titled ‘Diablo as imagined by a Rift Concept Artist.’ It got featured a lot on the internet and on the official Blizzard fan page. I was really pleasantly surprised how well it was received and it gave me a great boost of confidence to keep making fan art for my favorite games.

        <h2> FIRST PARAGRAPH</h2>
        It's true, concept art is a very competitive industry. There are some clichés to fall back on here: doing what you love will ultimately lead you to your dream career and your passion will drive your success but those are only part of the equation. You will need to be diligent about making connections with people. Attend school, go to meet-ups with other artists. Talk with industry professionals at conventions and share your work on the internet. The minimum bar of entry is being good at your craft so the time you spend learning and training will never be wasted.

        <h2>SECOND PARAGRAPH</h2> 
        The second is a piece I call The Fortune Teller. It's pretty old at this point but I include it simply because it was a bit of a turning point for me, when I first became really comfortable with digital painting and rendering more convincing materials and lighting. I also really enjoy the theme of the piece.

        <h2>THIRD PARAGRAPH</h2>   
        That's always a tough one. As a concept artist I try to have some flex in terms of style, leaning sometimes more into realistic rendering, other times going very stylized. I’m heavily influenced by Brom, Frazetta, Paul Richards, Joe Mad, Paul Bonner, Alphonse Muccha, Katsuya Terada, H.R. Giger, Simon Bisley, Edouard Guitton, Simon Lee, Eric Canete and a handful of others.
